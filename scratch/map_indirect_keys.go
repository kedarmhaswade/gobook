// Sometimes we need a map or set whose keys are slices, but because a mapâ€™s keys must be comparable,
// this cannot be expressed directly. However, it can be done in two steps.
// First we define a helper function k that maps each key to a string, with the property that k(x) == k(y)
//   if and only if we consider x and y equivalent.
// Then we create a map whose keys are strings, applying the helper function to each key before we access the map.
